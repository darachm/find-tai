    <h1>Tai has been found! 🥳🥳🥳🥳 </h1>
    <p>Baby Tai has returned to her new home. She just showed up, like "where's dinner?"
      FYI from what we heard from friends, it seems like cats that go roaming tend to
      return just about at sundown.</p>
    <p>While it was scary that Tai made an escape from the indoor cat life,
      it's super cool that she found her way back and choose to come back
      to her new family 🥲</p>
    <p>Thanks to you for caring enough about a cat to check up on her.
      Have a blessed day 🙌👍😎 </p>
